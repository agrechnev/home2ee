SQL SELECT unit testing mini-framework by Oleksiy Grechnyev

It has 3 level of testing:

--
 testSelect

Runs an SQL SELECT query with JDBC, after that you have to write your own asserter to check the results
--
 testSelectWithTable

Test the query results against a ResultTable object
--
 testSelectFullAuto

Runs an SQL SELECT query with both JDBC and an external SQL client and compare results
--

Usage: Run one of the 3 test methods from within a JUnit test routine. See RunDBTests.java for examples.

You will need to edit up the configuration file  scripts/dbtester.config

It contains JDBC connection parameters, plus one extra parameter DB_INITBEFOREEACH :
  DB_INITBEFOREEACH =true : run init scripts before each unit test (very slow)
  DB_INITBEFOREEACH = false : run init scripts only once

The scripts in the scripts/ directory are for MySQL, the method ResultsTable.readFromTableFile() is also tested
for MySQL only. Small modifications might be required for other SQL databases. The executable "mysql" must be
in your path, and your OS must be either Windows (.bat scripts) or Unix/Linux (.sh scripts).
